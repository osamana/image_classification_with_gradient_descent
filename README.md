# Project
A neural network classifier using the gradient descent. supports multiple hidden layers and cross validation

# Implemented Features:

- Image classification
- supports cross validation
- multiple hidden layers
- training data generation, with noise
- english and arabic letters
- up to 84% accuracy
- UI built with tkinter
- all parameters can be customized from the ui

# Credits
- Osama Abu Omar

# Run the project
- install python 3.7
- create a virtual environment (optional), then install the requirements
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- run the main.py file
